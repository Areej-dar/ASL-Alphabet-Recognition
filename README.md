# ASL Alphabet Detection

This project is a machine learning-based solution for recognizing and detecting American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets. The model processes input images of hand gestures and predicts the corresponding ASL alphabet. The implementation is carried out in a Jupyter Notebook and leverages popular machine learning frameworks for model development and training.

## Features

- **ASL Alphabet Detection**:
  - Recognizes hand gestures and maps them to ASL alphabets.
  - Designed for real-time or static image input.
- **Model Training**:
  - Uses supervised learning to train on a dataset of ASL alphabet images.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Tests model accuracy and performance on unseen data.
- **Visualization**:
  - Includes visualization of input data, training process, and predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code and experimentation.
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: 
  - **PyTorch**
  - **OpenCV** for image processing.
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
